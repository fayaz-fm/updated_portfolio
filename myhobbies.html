              <strong>I love web-designing.</strong> I got into web designing because it perfectly blends creativity with problem-solving, which I’ve always enjoyed. With my background in Electronics and Communication Engineering and experience in front-end development at Avasoft Inc., I found myself drawn to building visually appealing and functional websites. Working on sample websites made me realize how much I love bringing ideas to life through design and code. Plus, web development opens up so many opportunities, whether in UI/UX, full-stack development, or even integrating it with robotics and automation—areas I’m already passionate about.

              <strong>Always eager to learn Something which is new and intresting</strong> I enjoy learning different courses on Udemy because it gives me the flexibility to explore new skills at my own pace. Whether it’s web development, robotics, embedded systems, or data engineering, Udemy provides hands-on, practical knowledge that complements my academic and professional experience. It’s a great way to stay updated with industry trends and continuously upskill in areas like programming, automation, and design. Plus, the variety of courses helps me bridge gaps in my knowledge and apply what I learn to real-world projects.

              <strong>I love to play story mode games when I get time.</strong> I love story-driven games because they offer immersive narratives that pull me into different worlds, making me feel like I’m part of the journey. Whether it’s making tough choices that shape the outcome, exploring richly detailed environments, or connecting with deep, well-written characters, story games provide an experience beyond just gameplay. On my PS5, the stunning visuals and cinematic storytelling make these adventures even more engaging. Games like The Last of Us, God of War, and Red Dead Redemption 2 have shown me how powerful storytelling can be in gaming, blending emotion, action, and decision-making into unforgettable experiences.

                <strong>I love to design buildings and infrastructure which helps in increasing the reativity and innovation.</strong> I find designing buildings fascinating because it blends creativity, engineering, and functionality to create structures that are both aesthetic and practical. With my background in Electronics and Communication Engineering and my experience with Revit Architecture, I enjoy exploring architectural design, space planning, and structural layouts. The process of bringing a concept to life—whether through 3D modeling, visualization, or technical detailing—feels incredibly rewarding. Building design also connects with my interest in automation and smart technologies, making me curious about how modern buildings integrate IoT, energy efficiency, and intelligent systems for a futuristic approach.
